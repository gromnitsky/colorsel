  In the beginning there was <i>xcolorsel</i> program:
</p>

<p>
  It hasn't been updated since 1994, & its author says in the README,
  that he <q>consider[s] this tool as finished. No further extensions,
  bug fixes are planned.</q>
</p>

<p>
  In 2014 I was leaning a new-wave web framework
  called <i>Angular.js</i>, along with a hot syntactic-sugar language
  called CoffeeScript. Around that time, the original <i>xcolorsel</i>
  started producing code dumps, & instead of fixing its archaic
  code--which was using a
  heroic <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Athena_Widgets'>Xaw3d</a>
  widget library--I wrote a simple 'Angular app' to visualise X11
  rgb.txt type files, & named it <i>ColorSel</i>.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Angular.js</i> has been deprecated since 2018, if not
  earlier. Recently, I decided to add another colour list
  to ColorSel, but started laughing very hard after looking at
  its source code. The rewrite was long overdue. This time, with no
  web frameworks, & no syntactic-sugar helpers.
