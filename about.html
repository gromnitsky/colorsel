  In the beginning there was <i>xcolorsel</i> program:
</p>

  alt='xcolorsel program screen shot' src='xcolorsel.png'>

<p>
  It hasn't been updated since 1994, & its author says in the README,
  that he <q>consider[s] this tool as finished. No further extensions,
  bug fixes are planned.</q>
</p>

<p>
  In 2014 I was leaning a new-wave web framework
  called <i>Angular.js</i>, along with a hot syntactic-sugar language
  called CoffeeScript. Around that time, the original <i>xcolorsel</i>
  started producing core dumps, & instead of fixing its archaic
  code—which was using a
  heroic <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Athena_Widgets'>Xaw3d</a>
  widget library—I wrote a simple 'Angular app' to visualise X11
  rgb.txt type files, & named it <i>ColorSel</i>.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Angular.js</i> has been deprecated since 2018, if not
  earlier. Recently, I wanted to add another color list to ColorSel,
  but then decided to rewrite the app using a no-framework,
  no-build-step approach. ☕
