<p>
  Renders X11-like mappings of color names to RGB values. Historically,
  the famous <code>rgb.txt</code> file has been a primary
  example of such mappings:
</p>

<pre>
$ head -2 /usr/share/X11/rgb.txt
255 250 250             snow
248 248 255             ghost white
</pre>

<p>
  Clicking on the <i>Color</i> table header attempts to sort the table
  rows by hue, placing achromatic (or nearly achromatic) colors at the
  end.
</p>

<p>
  'Filter by' uses a substring match (requires
  pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> or clicking the Submit button).
</p>

<p>'Find most probable names' uses CIE color difference.</p>


<h2>History</h2>

<p>
  In the beginning there was <i>xcolorsel</i> program:
</p>

<img style="border: 1px solid gray"
  alt='xcolorsel program screen shot' src='xcolorsel.png'>

<p>
  It hasn't been updated since 1994, and its author says in the README
  that he <q>consider[s] this tool as finished. No further extensions,
  bug fixes are planned.</q>
</p>

<p>
  In 2014 I was leaning a new-wave web framework
  called <i>Angular.js</i>, along with a hot syntactic-sugar language
  called CoffeeScript. Around that time, the original <i>xcolorsel</i>
  started producing core dumps, and instead of fixing its archaic
  code—which was using a
  heroic <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Athena_Widgets'>Xaw3d</a>
  widget library—I wrote a simple 'Angular app' to visualise X11
  rgb.txt type files, and named it <i>ColorSel</i>.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Angular.js</i> has been deprecated since 2018, if not
  earlier. Recently, I wanted to add another color list to ColorSel,
  but then decided to rewrite the app using a no-framework,
  no-build-step approach.
</p>

<h2>Bugs</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Sorting by hue is suboptimal.</li>

  <li>
    When in the 'Find most probable names' mode, clicking on the
    'Color' table header should not be allowed, for it does nothing.
  </li>

  <li>
    Scrolling position between 'modes' is not retained.
  </li>

  <li>
    No support for pre-2025 browsers. ☕
  </li>
</ul>
